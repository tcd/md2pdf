> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

> How about `inline code` in a blockquote?

## Links

### Plain Links

Okay, here is a link. [This is the link.](https://www.google.com) And here is some more text. And **HERE IS SOME BOLD.**

### Styles on the Inside

Here's the start of a paragraph.
Now we're going to try a bold link. Ready? [**Here it is!**](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

And now a line through a link. [~~this is it. Line str8 through the middle~~](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) And some more text just for good measure.

### Styles on the Outside

Okay, now again but a little different. (putting the asterisks outside the link). **[It's back!](https://www.google.com)**

Okay, now one more link. (this time with the tildes outside the link). ~~[It's back!](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)~~
