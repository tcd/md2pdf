**Configuration Options**
---

1. Firewall

    + Turn on Firewall?
        - This helps protect your Mac from being attacked over the internet.
    + Turn on logging?
        - If there IS an infection, logs are useful for determining the source.
    + Turn on stealth mode?
        - Your Mac will not respond to ICMP ping requests or connection attempts from closed TCP and UDP networks.

2. General System Protection

    + Enable Gatekeeper?
    	- Defend against malware by enforcing code signing and verifying downloaded applications before allowing them to run.
    + Prevent automatic software whitelisting?
        - Both built-in and downloaded software will require user approval for whitelisting.
    + Disable Captive Portal Assistant and force login through browser on untrusted networks?
        - Captive Portal Assistant could be triggered and direct you to a malicious site WITHOUT any user interaction.

3. User Metadata Storage

    + Clear language modeling metadata?
        - This includes user spelling, typing and suggestion data.
    + Disable language modeling data collection?
    + Clear QuickLook metadata?
    + Clear Downloads metadata?
    + Disable metadata collection from Downloads?
    + Clear SiriAnalytics database?

4. User Safety

    + Lock Mac as soon as screen saver starts?
    + Display all file extensions?
    	- This prevents malware from disguising itself as another file type.
    + Disable saving documents to the cloud by default?
        - This prevents sensitive documents from being unintentionally stored on the cloud.
    + Show hidden files in Finder?
    	- This lets you see all files on the system without having to use the terminal.
    + Disable printer sharing?
        - Offers redundancy in case the Firewall was not configured.
